# Mnemosyne Protocol 🌉
**The Bridge Between Creative Chaos and Algorithmic Order.**

> *"GenAI forgets. Humans pay."*

Generative AI models are incredible at generating Frame 1. By Frame 25, they forget the character's scar, the lighting, and the plot. The Mnemosyne Protocol is an open-architecture orchestration layer designed to solve **Contextual Amnesia** in generative media pipelines.

We don't build models. We build the "Inverse Context Flow" layer beneath them. We sell rails, not trains.

## Core Features
* **Model-Agnostic Memory:** A portable continuity standard for studios.
* **Stateful Orchestration:** Translates story bibles into strict mathematical constraints.
* **100% IP Sovereignty:** Redaction policies ensure studio secrets never leak to public APIs.
* **Automated Continuity Gate:** Measures CLIP embedding distances of generated outputs against the "Memory Snapshot" before rendering.

# Mnemosyne-Core
A universal orchestration protocol that ensures contextual continuity ($C_t$), memory integrity ($M_t$), and secure data orchestration ($\mathcal{O}$) in multi-agent systems. A bridge between creative chaos and algorithmic order.

### Bridging Creative Chaos and Algorithmic Order.

Mnemosyne Labs is an applied research organization dedicated to solving **Contextual Fragmentation** in generative media workflows.

We are architecting **The Mnemosyne Protocol**, a proprietary vector-based framework that enables:
* **Systemic Consistency:** Maintaining character and environmental integrity across temporal sequences.
* **Inverse MCP Architecture:** Ensuring data sovereignty and IP protection for studios.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Harmonizing heterogeneous AI agents (Claude, Midjourney, Runway) into a unified production pipeline.
