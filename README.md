🎬 Mnemosyne Protocol: Core Orchestrator
The Contextual Orchestration Framework for Generative Media
"GenAI forgets. Humans pay."
Standard Generative AI pipelines (LLMs, Diffusion Models, Video Models like Sora/Runway) are exceptional content generators, but they are structurally stateless. For enterprise media production, relying on probabilistic generation leads to Contextual Amnesia—drifting characters, mutating environments, and broken IP constraints that require expensive, human-in-the-loop rework.
The Bridge Between Creative Chaos and Algorithmic Order. Mnemosyne is the solution: A deterministic, model-agnostic memory and orchestration layer that sits between the story bible and the generation pipeline.

📜 Documentation & Data Room
The theoretical framework and mathematical proof for the Mnemosyne Protocol is officially archived.
* Title: The Mnemosyne Protocol: A Contextual Orchestration Framework for Generative Media
* DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18685082
* Status: Preprint / Open Standard
* Read the full engineering specification: 
We are architecting The Mnemosyne Protocol, a proprietary vector-based framework that enables:
1. Systemic Consistency: Maintaining character and environmental integrity across temporal sequences.
2. Inverse MCP Architecture: Ensuring data sovereignty and IP protection for studios.
3. Agent Orchestration: Harmonizing heterogeneous AI agents (Claude, Midjourney, Runway) into a unified production pipeline.
"We are building the rails, not the trains."

⚡ Core Features
* Model-Agnostic Memory: A portable continuity standard for studios.
* Stateful Orchestration: Translates story bibles into strict mathematical constraints.
* 100% IP Sovereignty: Redaction policies ensure studio secrets never leak to public APIs.
* Automated Continuity Gate: Measures CLIP embedding distances of generated outputs against the "Memory Snapshot" before rendering.

🧮 The Mathematical Core: Fail-Closed Continuity
Mnemosyne replaces post-generation human rework with a runtime, discrete-time continuity gate. We define the overall Continuity State ($\Psi$) as a strict product-of-constraints:
$$\Psi(F_{0:T})=\prod_{t=0}^{T}\prod_{i=1}^{k}\text{Agent}_i(S_t)$$
If a single specialized verifier agent (e.g., Geometry Checker, Style Guard, Policy Engine) detects a violation and returns a 0, the gate fails closed. The frame is instantly rejected, triggering Algorithm 1: an automated localized rollback and re-sampling mechanism before the sequence is ever finalized.

📂 Repository Structure (Open-Core Artifacts)
This repository serves as the public validation and artifacts tracker for the Mnemosyne Protocol. While our Enterprise Engine remains proprietary, this repo contains executable proofs and simulation logs.
* /docs: Contains the v1.5 Whitepaper and architectural blueprints.
* /artifacts: Executable Python scripts demonstrating the PUSH_STATE and VERIFY messaging loops.
* /logs: Raw terminal outputs showing the [REJECT] -> [ROLLBACK] -> [ACCEPT] continuous verification cycles.
* /assets: Video demonstrations of the Orchestrator running via cloud-native terminal environments.

🗺️ Roadmap & Early Peer-Review Feedback (De-Risking Plan)
We have received early technical feedback highlighting three credibility gates: (1) reproducible baselines/benchmarks, (2) explicit cost/latency overhead, and (3) executable artifacts demonstrating Algorithm 1 beyond narrative description. We agree with these requirements and are addressing them in sequence:
* v1.5.1 (Artifacts Patch) - CURRENT: Publish executable code artifacts and demo traces for Algorithm 1 (fail-closed continuity gate + rollback + localized re-sampling).
* v1.6 (Benchmarks & Baselines) - UPCOMING: Release a reproducible benchmark suite with baseline comparisons (naive prompt chaining, memory buffer/RAG, self-consistency) and quantitative metrics (continuity hallucination rate, reject rate, latency/cost).
* v1.7 (Pilots & ROI) - PLANNED: Validate in design-partner pilots and publish ROI-style results under the same measurement harness.
All updates remain additive and backward-compatible at the protocol level.
