# Mnemosyne-Core
A universal orchestration protocol that ensures contextual continuity ($C_t$), memory integrity ($M_t$), and secure data orchestration ($\mathcal{O}$) in multi-agent systems. A bridge between creative chaos and algorithmic order.

### Bridging Creative Chaos and Algorithmic Order.

Mnemosyne Labs is an applied research organization dedicated to solving **Contextual Fragmentation** in generative media workflows.

We are architecting **The Mnemosyne Protocol**, a proprietary vector-based framework that enables:
* **Systemic Consistency:** Maintaining character and environmental integrity across temporal sequences.
* **Inverse MCP Architecture:** Ensuring data sovereignty and IP protection for studios.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Harmonizing heterogeneous AI agents (Claude, Midjourney, Runway) into a unified production pipeline.
